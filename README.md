**The homework**

## Float/Integer
1. `-123` - find out if it's odd?
2. `6893` - show what next number will be
3. `0` - show the previous number
4. `12` - cast it to float, then devide by `4.5` then round it up
5. `28` - call `modulo` by 6, then multiply result by `4.7` and round it down

## String
1. `"Brand new bicycle\r\n"` - remove trailing special characters
2. `"Brand new bicycle"` - using indexes extract ` new `
3. `"Brand new bicycle"` - delete last word
4. `"Brand new bicycle"` - check if the sctring's last word is `bicycle`
5. `"Brand new bicycle"` - find out what index the letter "w" has

6. `"I thought I knew everything before that night"` - split the string in 3 parts to get the following result: `"I thought I new "`, `"everything"`, `"before that night"`

7. `"Final result from Float/Integer part is: "` - using interpolation place the sum of all results from first 5 examples to the end of string.
